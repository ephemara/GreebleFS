# standalone_device_fn

Standalone `#[device]` function compilation — no `#[kernel]` required.

## What This Demonstrates

This example verifies that `#[device]` functions can be compiled to PTX without
any `#[kernel]` entry point in the crate. This is the foundation for building
Rust device libraries that are consumed by CUDA C++ via LTOIR linking.

## Test Coverage

| # | Test                       | What It Verifies                                                         |
|---|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Simple device functions    | `fast_sqrt`, `clamp_f32` appear as `.func` in PTX                        |
| 2 | Transitive calls           | `safe_sqrt` (calls `fast_sqrt` + `clamp_f32`) is collected               |
| 3 | Generic device function    | `fma_f32` (concrete wrapper around generic `fma<T>`) compiles            |
| 4 | GPU intrinsics             | `get_global_thread_id` (uses `thread::index_1d()`) compiles              |
| 5 | Multiple monomorphizations | Both `fma_f32` and `fma_i32` instantiations present                      |
| 6 | Uninstantiated generic     | Generic `unused_generic<T>` is correctly **absent** (not monomorphized)  |
| 7 | No `.entry` directives     | All functions are `.func`, not `.entry` (no kernels)                     |
| 8 | Clean export names         | No reserved `cuda_oxide_device_<hash>_` prefix in PTX function names     |

## How to Run

```bash
# From workspace root
cargo oxide run standalone_device_fn
```

Expected output:

```text
=== Standalone Device Function Compilation ===

PTX generated: standalone_device_fn.ptx (...)
  1. PASS  fast_sqrt found in PTX
  2. PASS  clamp_f32 found in PTX
  ...
  8. PASS  No .entry directives (all are .func)

SUCCESS: 8/8 tests passed
```

## How It Works

1. The `#[device]` macro renames functions with the reserved `cuda_oxide_device_<hash>_` prefix
   (owned by `crates/reserved-oxide-symbols/`).
   and generates an `#[inline(always)]` wrapper with the original name
2. The collector (`rustc-codegen-cuda/src/collector.rs`) detects standalone
   `#[device]` functions as compilation roots when no `#[kernel]` is present
3. The LLVM export layer strips the `cuda_oxide_device_<hash>_` prefix for clean
   names in the final output
4. Generic `#[device]` functions are only compiled if monomorphized by a
   concrete call site (standard Rust monomorphization rules)
