//! DisjointSlice - a type-safe abstraction for parallel GPU writes.
//!
//! This module provides `DisjointSlice<T>`, which guarantees that each thread
//! accesses a unique element, preventing data races.
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! Safety is enforced through the type system and bounds checking:
//!
//! 1. **ThreadIndex**: Can only be constructed by `index_1d` / `index_2d`,
//!    which derive the index from hardware built-in variables (`threadIdx`,
//!    `blockIdx`, `blockDim`) -- read-only special registers assigned by
//!    the runtime at kernel launch. The formula combines these into a
//!    scalar index per thread. **Caveat:** `index_2d` is sound only when
//!    every call in the kernel passes the same `row_stride`; mixing
//!    strides can mint colliding `ThreadIndex` values. See the docs on
//!    `thread::index_2d` for the full story and the planned fix.
//!
//! 2. **`get_mut()`**: Bounds-checked access via `ThreadIndex`. Returns
//!    `Option<&mut T>` — `None` for out-of-bounds threads. Sound by
//!    default, modulo the `index_2d` caveat above.
//!
//! 3. **`get_unchecked_mut()`**: Unsafe escape hatch for performance-critical
//!    paths where bounds have been validated by other means.
//!
//! The unsafe boundary is pushed to the construction of `DisjointSlice` from raw
//! memory, not to the per-access level.

use crate::thread::ThreadIndex;
use core::marker::PhantomData;

/// A slice-like type that can only be accessed with thread-local indices.
///
/// # Safety Invariants
///
/// The type system enforces these invariants:
/// 1. Default access via `get_mut(ThreadIndex)` is bounds-checked and sound.
/// 2. `ThreadIndex` can only be created by `index_1d` / `index_2d`, which
///    derive the index from hardware built-in variables -- read-only
///    special registers assigned by the runtime at launch.
/// 3. Each thread's `ThreadIndex` is unique. For `index_1d` this is
///    unconditional; for `index_2d(row_stride)` it holds only within a
///    single, fixed `row_stride` -- a known soundness gap, see
///    `thread::index_2d`.
///
/// Subject to the `index_2d` caveat in (3), each thread accesses a
/// unique element, making parallel writes safe without synchronization.
///
/// # Memory Layout
///
/// Internally, this is identical to a slice: `{ ptr: *mut T, len: usize }`
/// The safety comes from type-level enforcement and bounds checking.
///
/// # Soundness
///
/// `get_mut()` returns `Option<&mut T>`, making out-of-bounds access
/// impossible in safe code. The previous API (`get() -> &mut T`) relied on
/// the caller to check bounds externally; in release builds this was UB for
/// out-of-bounds indices — a soundness hole. The current design follows
/// `slice::get_mut()` / `slice::get_unchecked_mut()` from std: the safe
/// path is always sound, and the unsafe escape hatch (`get_unchecked_mut`)
/// is explicitly opted into.
///
/// The type is `Send` but NOT `Sync`: each GPU thread gets its own copy of
/// the struct (with the same backing pointer), then uses its unique
/// `ThreadIndex` to access a different element. Sharing `&DisjointSlice`
/// across threads is not meaningful.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use cuda_device::{thread, DisjointSlice};
///
/// #[kernel]
/// pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
///     let idx = thread::index_1d();
///     if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(idx) {
///         *c_elem = a[idx.get()] + b[idx.get()];
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// # Safety Argument

    /// This method is safe (not marked `unsafe`) because:
    ///
    /// 1. **Bounds checked**: Returns `None` for out-of-bounds indices.
    ///
    /// 2. **Unique access (with one current caveat)**: `ThreadIndex` can
    ///    only be constructed by `index_1d()` or `index_2d()`, which
    ///    derive the index from hardware built-in variables (`threadIdx`,
    ///    `blockIdx`, `blockDim`) -- read-only special registers assigned
    ///    by the runtime at kernel launch. `index_1d` produces unique
    ///    values unconditionally. `index_2d(row_stride)` is unique only
    ///    *within a single, fixed `row_stride`* -- mixing strides inside
    ///    one kernel can yield colliding `ThreadIndex` values today (see
    ///    `thread::index_2d` for details). Until the principled fix
    ///    lands, callers using `index_2d` must pin `row_stride` to one
    ///    binding per kernel.
    ///
    /// 3. **No data races**: Given the constraint above, each thread's
    ///    `ThreadIndex` is unique, and threads cannot share `ThreadIndex`
    ///    values, so each thread accesses a different memory location.
